Installed using homebrew

Start server using `mysql.server start`
Apparently this does not run in the background... or smth

Connect using `mysql -u root`

From the installation output:

We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation

To start mysql now and restart at login:
  brew services start mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir\=/usr/local/var/mysql
